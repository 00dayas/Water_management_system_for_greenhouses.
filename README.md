# Water_management_system_for_greenhouses.
This Project Is designed for greenhouses to monitor and irrigate the plants. Temperature, humidity, water level, soil moisture, motor run status, etc... are collected and sent to the cloud.
This system uses NODE MCU to collect data from different sensors and process the data and send it to could. Here I am using Thingspeak server.
I have also attached codes to calibrate sensors which are connected you the micro-controller
For accurate results please calibrate your system.
